    "\n",
    "Voter turnout reflects the health of a democratic system, measuring the participation of its members in the electoral process.  However, it is widely documented that voter turnout varies significantly across demographic groups such as age, race, education, and income. Research finds that nonvoters are more likely to be younger, identify as non-White, have low education, and come from low income households ([Pew Research Group, 2023](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2023/07/12/voter-turnout-2018-2022/)). Further understanding these patterns is crucial for identifying barriers to participation and designing policies to improve turnout ([MIT, 2021](https://electionlab.mit.edu/research/voter-turnout)).\n",

    "This project explores the predictive power of voter characteristics on voter turnout for the 2020 presidential election in the state of Massachusetts. By leveraging Census Block Group data, this study aims to uncover localized patterns that aggregate county or state-level studies ([Ansolabehere et al., 2024](https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/0c5ylgo1/release/2)) or individual-level studies ([Kim, 2024](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11109-022-09816-z#Sec14)) may overlook.\n",

    "To answer this question, we use voter turnout data at the Census Block level sourced from L2 Data and Redistricting Data Hub.\n",
    "\n",
    "We applied several processing steps which included:\n",
    "1. Dropped observations without Census Block IDs that were instead aggregated to the County level (73,811 or ~1.60% of total voters). Disaggregating these observations necessitated the assumption that demographic characteristics are uniformly distributed across the County, which is false.\n",
    "2. Aggregated the Census Block data to the Census Block Group level to reduce the high variance of registered voter counts in each observation.\n",
    "3. Converted most demographic predictors from counts of voters to proportion of voters. We did this to account for differences in the number of voters that lived in each Census Block Group (a Census Block Group in a city will likely have a higher voter count than a Census Block Group in rural Massachusetts).\n",
    "\n",
    "Our response variable is the proportion of registered voters that voted in the 2020 presidential election, denoted as `2020_turnout_pct`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our predictors include the total number of voters registered, mean household income, and the proportion of people with specific characteristics such as age; ethnicity; party affiliation; and language."
